This a java program for simply student management system. It is a menu based program which is very simple for adding a new student with a roll number, age and admit course. It is also Used for removal of students from a list, also used for updating any student informations and display the full list as well. 
The whole program is basically operated using a menu and full project contains two programs there student.java and student managemnt.java. 
Out of these two program student managemnt.java is the driver program. 
NB: This program is using an array list and in future I try to convert array list to file and also introduce some new features like segregation of different departments or different semesters etc. I also convert these files for storing all records permanently into storage device.
